WELCOME BACK!!!!

	after moving to Dubai in November 27 of 2023... 

I made almost one year without coding or doing anything related to software engineer 
it was tough , i didn't have a good machine, but now i invested in one (AUG-SEP of 2024),
I'm currently a security guard at a company called black falcon, I'm earning minimum wage and struggling health wise.

i wish, hope and pray for a better circumstance of life as my contract is halfway done, i need to be proactive in finding and making a better standard for myself so i can be a free thinker do things that actually matter , i pray i find a solution ASAP otherwise I'm fucked!!!!
